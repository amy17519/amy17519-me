This was my second project at NYC Data Science Academy. Also, it was my first time using R Shiny to create a website for public use. It was fun and I started to develop interests in front-end development afterward. If you happen to be a parent in New York City, I hope you find this [website](https://amy17519.shinyapps.io/PreKapp/) useful for planning your kid's early education.

# Motivation

In 2013, Mayor De Blasio campaigned on a promise of universal pre-kindergarten. The program makes access to free pre-kindergarten education available to all NYC families, regardless of child's abilities and family income. Now, three years later, NYC enrolls more children in full-day pre-K than any state except Georgia, and its preschool enrollment exceeds the total number of students in San Francisco or Boston. While the statistics show a positive outlook in early child education, the program received complaints and doubts from parents. Although every city child is promised a free seat, many children were slotted for schools miles away from their home. Also, as the number of pre-K locations increases to accommodate all four-year-old children, the quality of the education is in question.

In this project, I created a Shiny app as a comprehensive guide for parents who do not understand Universal Pre-K or simply want to find the closest and most suitable pre-K for their child. This Pre-K guide gives information about each pre-Kâ€™s location, contacts, meal plans, playspace, extended daycare options, and enrollment restrictions. Also, it allows the public to visualize whether there are enough seats for eligible kids in each borough.

# Overview of Pre-K Explorer

Pre-K Explorer has five sections, each with helpful information about Universal Pre-K. _Pre-K Map_ allows users to locate preschools in their neighborhood. _Pre-K Catalog_ shows detailed contact and facility information of all pre-K's in NYC. _Pre-K Statistics_ helps one visualize whether the supply and demand of preschool education is balanced. _About Universal Pre-K Program_ provides information about application and eligibility. Finally, _About This Site_ contains data sources and selected articles about the program.

# Are There Enough Seats at Pre-K?

Mayor De Blasio promised that every eligible kid in NYC would get a free seat at a local preschool, but is this true? Although city officials insist that a child would never be placed in another borough, [CBS New York](http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/05/09/universal-pre-k-complaints/) found at least two cases where that happened. A visualization comparing available seats at preschools and estimated four-year-old kid population shows that preschools in NYC are far from ready to accommodate all eligible children. The orange and red bars show the estimated numbers of four-year-old children based on 2010 Census Report and 2014 Annual Population Estimate respectively. The real population of four-year-old children may be vastly higher than these estimates because the [population growth in all NYC boroughs were faster than expected](http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2016/03/23/nyc-s-population-tops-8-5-million-for-first-time--new-census-figures-show.html) in the past two years.

The shortage of seats at preschools sums up to over 20,000 or more in all boroughs.

# Technical Details

## Data Cleaning

It is important to ensure all pre-K locations have correct geographic information before mapping. I used the function, `geocode()`, in R package `ggmap` to convert all addresses into GPS coordinates. To increase accuracy, I pasted zip codes after each address. Unfortunately, while `geocode()`  can convert most addresses correctly, there were incorrect cases. To remedy this problem, I used the latitudes and longitudes of NYC's geographic boundaries to filter out incorrect locations and reassign them correct geographic coordinates.

```
################## use address to get long/lat info ################
kinder <- read.csv(url("https://github.com/amy17519/NYCPre-KGuide/blob/master/Universal_Pre-K__UPK__School_Locations.csv"), 
                   stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

###### paste zipcodes to all addresses to increase accuracy of locating
kinder$address<- paste(kinder$address,kinder$zip)
geo<-geocode(kinder$address) #use geocode from ggmap package to get longtitude/latitude coordinates
geo<-geo[,c(2,1)]   #change col order of long and lat to match convention 

#Find abnormal locations using longitude/latitude boundaries of NYC
#Northernmost pt:40.916541, -73.906637
#Southernmost pt:40.525095, -74.246319
#Easternmost pt:40.722813, -73.688498
#Westernmost pt:40.510940, -74.253454

##### there are 18 suspicious locations that might not be in NYC
index<-which(geo$lat>=40.916541 | geo$lat<= 40.525095 |
             geo$lon>=-73.688498 | geo$lon<= -74.253454)
```

# Pre-K Map - Leaflet Map

Having correct geographic coordinates ready, I proceeded to create a `leaflet` map for pre-K locations. The goal was to create a user-friendly map for parents to smoothly browse preschool locations near home and visualize available seats at each location. I used `clusterOptions=markerClusterOptions()` to group locations so users can visualize which neighborhoods have a high density of preschools. The radius of each circle is normalized by the seat availability, hence pre-Ks with more seats are marked by larges bubbles and vice versa. Also, the colors of bubbles help visualize school types.

In order to increase efficiency, I used `observe()` function to draw bubbles/locations whenever the user selects new search criteria. This function prevents Leaflet from having to redraw the entire map, which enhances user experience and webpage efficiency.

Please go to [Github repo](https://github.com/amy17519/NYCPre-KGuide) for code details. This is a screenshot of the resulting map.

# Pre-K Catalog - Data Table

Pre-K Catalog provides a searchable directory for parents to browse available locations. Users can simply search for criteria that are important to them and filter out the most suitable pre-K locations near home. This is how the Pre-K Catalog looks on the Shiny App. Users can also select locations they are interested in for instant comparisons.

# Pre-K Statistics - googleVis

I wanted to let users visualize the supply and demand of pre-K seats in each borough as well as the whole of NYC. I used `googleVis` to create bar plots of kid population and seat availability at preschools. Users can also customize graphs by boroughs and kid population data source. An interesting option under `googleVis`, `gvis.editor`, allows users to even customize the vertical bar plots into line charts, horizontal bar plots, and more.

This is how the Pre-K Statistics look on the Shiny App. Users can use both filter panel on the left and the Customize button on top left corner to customize the graph.
