With lots of help, I organized the inaugural SatRday LA conference at UCLA Alumni Center on April 6, 2019. I promised myself (and publicly on a Slack —> I guess this is really why I am posting now) to write a blogpost about my organizing experience. First of all, what I am about to talk about are just how we decided to organize a SatRday and you are free to organize SatRday in any way you like, as long as you don’t violate [SatRday Org’s important requirements](https://knowledgebase.satrdays.org/organising/).

Some numbers about SatRday LA 2019:

- 206 people registered and 180 people showed up
- 9 talks, 3 workshops, and 2 keynotes
- $35 for Professional, $15 for Student
- 14 students were sponsored by another attendee
- 127+67 = 194 commits on SatRday LA repos

## Motivation
There used to be regular, sizable R meetups in (West) LA, where I learned about R’s capabilities and made a lot of friends. Also, we haven't had any R-focused conferences in SoCal since useR! 2014 at UCLA. I personally feel spoiled by past organizers such as Szilard and Eduardo, and thought it was time for someone to step up and start organizing R events in West LA. After useR! 2018, this thought became stronger.

I first heard about SatRday from my coworker, Gergely Daróczi, who also happen to be the guy who organized the very first SatRday in Budapest, Hungary (You can read about his experience [here](http://datascience.la/how-to-organize-a-satrday-conference-v0-1/). It did not take me long to commit to organizing SatRday LA since it matches what I look for in an opensource R event: :white_check_mark: R-focused , :white_check_mark: affordable, :white_check_mark: inclusive and accessible.

Before I start the organizing process, I set some additional requirements for SatRday LA. First, I hope that this conference covers diverse topics and paradigms in #rstats. Although it is only an one-day conference and we do not have resources to have a lot of tracks, I hope attendees at different levels can learn something at the event. Second, I want to ensure that I prepare enough branding materials and a very basic workflow for future SatRday LA organizers. That just means I will have to be super organized and document everything :grin:.


## Organizing Process
#### Pick a Date
Step one is to sign up on SatRday's [event calendar](https://github.com/satRdays/eventscalendar). I went through a quick process of elimination and picked Q2 2019. You would need to pick a date range that would not conflict with other local and international R or data science conferences. Also, try not to pick summer or spring break because it would be hard to get students in those times.

#### Venue
Organizing an affordable conference means that you need to be cautious about how much things cost ahead of time. The cost of venue could vary a lot, and directly links to your event ticket prices and how many sponsors you need to get. So, we decided to find a venue first. I selfishly wanted to organize the first SatRday LA at UCLA because it is my alma mater and it is close to my home :no_mouth: ... Fortunately, we found UCLA Alumni Association as our venue partner, and I am forever grateful for their support!

In addition to cost, it is important to lock a date with your venue early so that you have more date options.

#### Organizing Committee
My advice is to keep organizing committee small (2~3 ppl) and make sure they understand the amount of work involved in the organizing process. Also, try to have a constant channel for instant communication with all organizers. In our case, SatRday's slack workspace was great and I could get a response from my co-organizers within a day. Overall, we had less than 5 short meetings.

#### Program Committee
You do not have to separate Program and Organizing Committee, but that was my choice. Program Committee members should be experienced and _critical_ R users. That is important, especially if we want to have a diverse range of topics and let people present _different_ ways of using R. We aimed to have 5~10 committee members, and we had 6 at the end. Special thanks to Szilard for connecting me with most program committee members. And thanks to all committee members for accepting my invitation without hesitation. Our Program Committee had 0 meeting and discussed everything on slack. 

You do not need to worry about sending submissions and designing rubrics for Program Committee. SatRday organizers can use Sessionize for free to manage submissions, which definitely saved us a lot of time.

#### Budgets

#### Keynote and Invited Speakers

#### Sponsors

#### Marketing 

#### Finance

## Side Effects 
I still type SatRday instead of Saturday a lot of times. And iPhone autocorrect stopped working a long time ago
Now I am on Twitter too much ….
